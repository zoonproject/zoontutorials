# Species Distribution Modelling tutorials using zoon

Introductory tutorials and best practice guides for species distribution modelling using the zoon R package.

You can install the package from GitHub with:

```r
devtools::install_github('zoonproject/zoontutorials')
```

and load the introductory tutorial as a vignette with:

```r
library(zoontutorials)
vignette('Intro_Module')
```

The introductory tutorial is only in a very early draft stage at the moment, please let us know what you think we should cover in the repo's issues tracker.
