# Species Distribution Modelling tutorials using zoon

Introductory tutorials and best practice guides for species distribution modelling using the zoon R package.

You can install the package from GitHub with:

```r
devtools::install_github('zoonproject/zoontutorials')
```

and load the introductory tutorial as a vignette with:

```r
library(zoontutorials)
vignette('Intro_Module')
```

Alternatively, you can check some of the tutorials and guides out in your browser, e.g. [the basic introduction](https://cdn.rawgit.com/goldingn/zoontutorials/563c74c1/inst/doc/Introduction.html)

The introductory tutorials are only in a very early draft stage at the moment. Please let us know what you think we should cover in the repo's issues tracker!
